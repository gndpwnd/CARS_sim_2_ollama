# ðŸ“… Fall 2025 Research Progress Plan

## 1. Background Research & Literature Collection

1. **Survey communication denial resistance mechanisms**

   * Find research papers on fault-tolerant distributed systems (LLMs, MAS, and classical networking).
   * Collect papers on redundant communication, rerouting, and graceful degradation in multi-agent AI.
   * Identify existing benchmarks that include communication failures.

2. **Review adaptive communication strategies**

   * Gather work on dynamic topology optimization, bandwidth-aware scheduling, and compression techniques.
   * Look for research in robotics swarms and distributed AI for analogies.

3. **Explore adversarial communication attacks**

   * Find cybersecurity literature on denial-of-service in distributed AI.
   * Collect works applying game theory to adversarial LLM systems.

4. **Evaluation methodologies**

   * Identify metrics/frameworks for resilience testing.
   * Look at "leave-one-out" (IntrospecLOO) and alternative contribution assessment methods under constraints.

## 2. System Design & Development

5. **Prototype communication denial scenarios**

   * Build a simulation environment (Python, Ray, or custom MAS framework).
   * Implement sparse communication topologies with adjustable link failure probability.
   * Test system behavior under random link failures vs. targeted failures.

6. **Develop adaptive communication strategies**

   * Implement dynamic rerouting of messages.
   * Experiment with compression (summarization of agent messages).
   * Evaluate trade-offs between cost and performance.

7. **Adversarial attack module**

   * Simulate denial-of-service or targeted communication blocking.
   * Explore defenses: redundant communication, decoy channels.

## 3. Evaluation & Testing

8. **Resilience testing framework**

   * Define performance metrics (accuracy, task completion, efficiency, degradation curve).
   * Run experiments under:

     * Ideal communication
     * Random link failures
     * Targeted adversarial denial

9. **Benchmark comparison**

   * Compare with standard MAS baselines (fully connected, fixed sparse topology).
   * Measure computational efficiency gains/losses.

10. **Case study domains**

* Pick one practical application (e.g., traffic control or disaster response).
* Run simulations to test robustness in real-world-inspired environments.

## 4. Writing & Dissemination

11. **Draft methodology paper section**

* Document design of communication denial simulations.
* Summarize adaptive strategy experiments.

12. **Prepare results section**

* Include graphs for performance vs. communication reliability.
* Show resilience metrics across scenarios.

13. **Write future work & discussion**

* Identify gaps not covered (e.g., multimodal integration under denial).
* Suggest longer-term research beyond Fall 2025.
