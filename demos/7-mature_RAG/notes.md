I have the following old python script rag_store.py that I want to make a new version using the hybrid scalable version discussed in the attatched README.md. I have also attatched a demo of how to use lightRAG with OLLAMA and lightRAG with ollama and neo4j. I have also attatched my project's docker compose file. Please return a script to handle the hybrid system of postgreSQL and Qdrant with necessary plugins. I want to make sure that telemetry data is specifically sent to Qdrant and that agent relationships and MCP message chains are specifically sent to PostgreSQL.

So how does it know if the data being passed to add_log is messages on the MCP or agent telemetry, can i refactor the code so that I have a function specifically to add agent telemetry (add_telemetry) to qdrant and then a function to add mcp messages (add_mcp_messages)
