I have a following project to demonstrate the user of an LLM to help a human user interpret situational awareness through reducing alert fatigue and helping to micromanage a complex system.

The following code demonstrates the ability to have an LLM control the movements of agents using an MCP and i want you to see how it works. Wait for me to upload my complex gps system. I want to implement the ability for the LLM to move agents by the same methods seen in this demo. If you could please help me update or add tools to my mcp to allow the LLM to move agents in my complex gps system that would be great. Please wait for me to upload my complex gps system before proceeding.




I have the following code for a multi agent simulation that is enabled by an LLM to reduce alert fatigue and help micromanage the cluster of agents. I also have a GPS constellation that I try to give each agent its current position using multilateral from each satellite. I want to be able to plot the satellites on the same plot as the agents so that I can see where the satellites are in real time because if you think about it the world itself is a map that is normalized to both the satellites and what would be the agents. So I want the plot to be the map that is normalized to the GPS locations and the agents locations. And to simulate the GPS orbits I would like to have all satellites be plotted along the radius of a circle that is a fixed radius of let's say eight units and the center of the circle is 00 or the origin. So from the origin a radius of eight units and it is simply a line that shows the circumference of the circle thin dotted line I might add and each satellite is randomly spawned along this dotted line Is constantly moving in a orbit along this line satellites can be moving clockwise or counterclockwise I just want to have each satellite move in a specified direction for the entirety of the simulation so pick either clockwise or counter clockwise randomly for each satellite when it is spawned. Please help me add this functionality to my existing code. Here is the code for my multi agent simulation with an LLM enabled MCP. Please help me add the GPS satellite plotting and movement functionality to this code.
