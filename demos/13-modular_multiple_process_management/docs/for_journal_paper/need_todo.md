this is an issue, there is no LLM command approval architecture, and test have not been done. we cannot add this to the paper. or does the paper already have an architecture for human approval? if not then we cannot put it..



so future development o f the simulation would include:







human operator approval for LLM commands





varying levels of approval, currently all LLM commands are approved to study LLM effectiveness as guiding the swarm





and then i need my code to be analayzed for what can be added.... what does my code already feature and what does it not already feature...
