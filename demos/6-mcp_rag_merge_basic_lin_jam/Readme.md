# Integrating MCP with RAG for LLM and Agent Jamming Simulation


### Run the simulation

```
docker compose down -v; sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./pgdata; rm -rf ./pgdata; docker compose up -d; python sim.py
```

### Run the MCP and RAG enabled chatapp

```
python3 mcp_chatapp.py
```


mcp_rag_chatapp and the simulation need to be in the same memory space so that the mcp can actually influence the agents in the simulation. OR the simulation needs to be open to allow for other programs to influence it. in a real world hardware setup, you would simply interact with a hardware api and not have to jerry rig a simulation to do this.

need to add waypoints and linear path to waypoints

```python
def add_waypoint(agent_id, target_x, target_y):
    """
    Add a waypoint for the specified agent.
    The agent will move to this waypoint in a linear path.
    """
    global agent_waypoints, agent_paths, agent_full_paths

    with data_lock:  # Ensure thread-safe access
        # Parse the agent ID to handle different formats
        agent_id_str = parse_agent_id(agent_id)

        # Check if agent exists
        if agent_id_str not in swarm_pos_dict:
            print(f"[ERROR] Cannot add waypoint - Agent {agent_id_str} does not exist")
            return False

        # Ensure target is within bounds
        target_x = max(min(float(target_x), x_range[1]), x_range[0])
        target_y = max(min(float(target_y), y_range[1]), y_range[0])
        target_pos = (target_x, target_y)

        # Initialize waypoints list if not exists
        if agent_id_str not in agent_waypoints:
            agent_waypoints[agent_id_str] = []

        # Add the waypoint to the queue
        agent_waypoints[agent_id_str].append((target_x, target_y))

        # Generate a linear path from current position to waypoint
        current_pos = swarm_pos_dict[agent_id_str][-1][:2]
        linear_path = generate_linear_path(current_pos, target_pos)

        # Save the path
        agent_paths[agent_id_str] = linear_path

        # Ensure we save the FULL path for plotting and prevent early clearing
        agent_full_paths[agent_id_str] = linear_path.copy()
        print(f"[DEBUG] Set full path for visualization with {len(linear_path)} points: {agent_full_paths[agent_id_str]}")

        # Set the agent mode to user_directed
        agent_modes[agent_id_str] = "user_directed"

        # Log the addition of a waypoint
        log_agent_data(agent_id_str, current_pos, {
            'action': 'waypoint_added',
            'waypoint': target_pos,
            'source': 'user_command'
        })

        print(f"[DEBUG] Added waypoint for {agent_id_str}: ({target_x}, {target_y})")
        print(f"[DEBUG] Generated linear path with {len(linear_path)} points")

        # Log the current state of waypoints for debugging
        print_waypoints_status()

    return True
```


I have the following mcp_chatapp that I am trying to fix to interact with a python simulation. Currently when i send a move command the agent doesn't actuallly move. I want to have a waypoint system where if there was a command to move an agent, then a waypoint of that desination will be added to the agent, the agent will then move in a linear pattern toward that waypoint untill reached the waypoint. Also, will the chatapp be in the same memoryspace as the simulation? how can I have it so that the mcp server can actually influence the simulation??
