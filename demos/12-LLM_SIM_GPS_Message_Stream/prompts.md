I have the following code that i am trying to accomplish the following requirements.

I want the chat interface and database messaging /data streaming viewer in a webapp, then a dashboard to view the simulation itself with agent positions to be using the matplotlib. This way neither are crowded. But i want to have both the webapp and matplotlib interfaces. I also want to have the optional notification board so i can show users how much information they need to keep track of.


I understand what you need! You want three separate interfaces:

Web Chat App (port 5000) - Chat interface + RAG/database streaming viewer (PostgreSQL + Qdrant + Chat Interface)
Matplotlib Dashboard (sim.py) - Live agent positions visualization with control buttons
Requirements Notification Board (optional) - PyQt5 dashboard showing GPS requirements status


the requirements dashboard can be spawned from a button on the matplotlib simulation, and be a separate window

The current problem:

Looking at your code, I can see the issues. You're trying to run the API server twice (once in sim.py and once when called from startup.py), and the matplotlib GUI isn't displaying properly because of threading and process management issues.
Let me help you fix this by separating the GUI components like your demo code. Here's the solution:


I am trying to correct my code to run the main gui and notification dashboard as a separate python app and then have my simulation and chatapp as another app. this way i can properly open and view the GUI instead of having it started as some background process. please help me complete this migration of code. i ultimately want to have the following files to run. Please reuse existing code if that helps decrease complexity, i want this to be as concise as possible and plain simple.

start_sim.py

start_gui.py

Please note what code and files i already have so you don't have to make duplicate files.



I am trying to make my gui work for my simulation, right now when i run main gui, 

(venv) dev@DB-78GB094:~/CARS_sim_2_ollama/demos/12-LLM_SIM_GPS_Message_Stream$ python main_gui.py

but i don't actually see a gui. i have the following code:

I am basing it on the following from a basic demo that still works. I have uploaded the rest of my simulation code as well


Looking at your code, the issue is that your matplotlib GUI isn't being displayed properly. The problem is in how you're setting up and running the matplotlib animation. Here are the key issues:
The matplotlib window isn't being forced to display before the animation starts
The animation creation and plt.show() might not be properly synchronized
There might be backend issues with TkAgg in WSL2


Looking at your code, I can now see the issue! The problem is that document 11 (the working GUI) uses a completely different approach than your current main_gui.py:Working GUI (document 11):

Uses matplotlib.use("Qt5Agg") backend
Uses FigureCanvasQTAgg (matplotlib embedded in PyQt5)
Uses QTimer for animation updates
Is a full PyQt5 application with matplotlib embedded
Your non-working GUI (document 9):

Uses matplotlib.use('TkAgg') backend
Uses standalone matplotlib windows
Uses FuncAnimation for animation
Is a matplotlib-only application trying to spawn PyQt5 dashboards
The issue is that you're mixing TkAgg matplotlib with PyQt5, which causes conflicts in WSL2. Here's the fixed version that uses the Qt5Agg backend properly:
