I have the existing code that i am trying to make the following demo:  

an mcp chatapp 

multi-agent simulation 

GPS message generator for simulation

notification dashboard - a gui to monitor events in the simulation so i can see live telemetry streaming, and ultimately how often the LLM can help fix errors.

requirements tracker i'll be able to see all information about each agent to cross reference the reports the LLM gives me.

I ultimately want to be able to ask the llm for a report on the agents currently, and the LLM looks at the most current information for every agent from each database and makes a human friendly report. then i want to be able to move agents to specific coordinates. in the chatapp, i want to send a message to the user on startup giving a menu of commands and the bounds of the simulation coordinate system. I then also want to be able to have a converstation with the LLM about the simulation and have it be able to make human friendly -readable reports.

I want to make sure that my simulation is not getting over complicated, the agents should spawn in random locations, and move toward the mission end point, the mission end point should be in the top right most corner of the sim boundaries denoted by a star symbol, so placed at max x and max y. I want to be able to switch between algorithm control (if run into jamming, recover by going back to previous non jammed position, then go to a random coordinate withing a maximum allowed single iteration movement distance, if still jammed, go back to that spot and pick a new random spot, then continue on a linear path to the mission end point.

I only want the GPS simulator to help simulate acutall NMEA messages, don't worry about RTCM for now, just NMEA. I want to more accurately simulate that connection is lost or degraded when agents venture into jammed areas and have this reflected in the NMEA messages.

I want to overall make my simulation more simple but not reduce the core quality and components. telemetry is recorded to qdrant and all agent, LLM, and user messages are recorded to sql. 

Please ask clarifying questions as needed. Overall please show me what functions or files need to be updated. I want to make minimal changes but at the same time really make the whole thing simpler to meet my requirements.


Clarifying Questions
GPS Integration: Do you want the GPS constellation server to run as a separate service, or should it be integrated into the main simulation loop? Currently, agents query it over TCP.

Requirements Tracking: Should the 12 GPS denial requirements continue to be monitored, or can we simplify this to basic jamming detection (satellite count, signal quality, fix quality)?

LLM Reports: When you ask for a "report on agents," should it include:

Current positions and jamming status?
GPS metrics (satellites, signal quality)?
Movement history?
All of the above?



Startup Menu: Should this menu appear in the web chat interface, terminal, or both?

Database Strategy: You mentioned telemetry → Qdrant, messages → PostgreSQL. Should we keep both or simplify to just PostgreSQL with vector extension?


GPS- i want the best solution that is the simplest for me to get the results i need, i am only trying to show how LLM can improve performace of a multi agent swarm. the GPS generator is really just for creating simulated telemetry and generate warnings and errors for the LLM to take into consideration when creating reports and also assisting with moving agents automatically.

Requirements Tracking - it would be nice to simplify for now, i can always add requirements later, but keep the ability to add requirements in the future. for now just basic jamming detection is fine.

LLM Reports: When you ask for a "report on agents," should it include:

for a "current status" report i just want: Current positions and jamming status, GPS metrics (satellites, signal quality)

this should be good enough for now.

but please don't hard code any message monitoring in the mcp chatapp. i want the LLM to interpret what the user wants through the MCP chatapp and then query the databases as needed to get the most current information or simply be able to say to return the commands menu or something.














currently, my mcp chatapp is getting a "No response received". this is a demo MCP chatapp if youd like to fix my existing one. I am only showing you this to help identify what could be wrong with my existing mcp chatap. and the start menu should be just fine.


then for the simulation itself, i do not see the streams of NMEA messages between the satelites and the agents in the postgresql stream, i guess i would like to add this data collection as well. I then want to mention that none of the agents seem to be moving toward the mission endpoint, they just seem to be having their gps information updated as iteration of the simulation occurs. I want the agents to move toward the mission endpoint unless they are jammed, in which case they should try to recover as mentioned before.

please show me what files need to be updated and what functions need to be changed. I want to make minimal changes but at the same time really make the whole thing simpler to meet my requirements.
