I want the chat interface and database messaging /data streaming viewer in a webapp, then a dashboard to view the simulation itself with agent positions to be using the matplotlib. This way neither are crowded. But i want to have both the webapp and matplotlib interfaces. I also want to have the optional notification board so i can show users how much information they need to keep track of.


I understand what you need! You want three separate interfaces:

Web Chat App (port 5000) - Chat interface + RAG/database streaming viewer (PostgreSQL + Qdrant + Chat Interface)
Matplotlib Dashboard (sim.py) - Live agent positions visualization with control buttons
Requirements Notification Board (optional) - PyQt5 dashboard showing GPS requirements status


the requirements dashboard can be spawned from a button on the matplotlib simulation, and be a separate window

The current problem:

Looking at your code, I can see the issues. You're trying to run the API server twice (once in sim.py and once when called from startup.py), and the matplotlib GUI isn't displaying properly because of threading and process management issues.
Let me help you fix this by separating the GUI components like your demo code. Here's the solution:


I am trying to correct my code to run the main gui and notification dashboard as a separate python app and then have my simulation and chatapp as another app. this way i can properly open and view the GUI instead of having it started as some background process. please help me complete this migration of code. i ultimately want to have the following files to run. Please reuse existing code if that helps decrease complexity, i want this to be as concise as possible and plain simple.

start_sim.py

start_gui.py

Please note what code and files i already have so you don't have to make duplicate files.



I am trying to make my gui work for my simulation, right now when i run main gui, 

(venv) dev@DB-78GB094:~/CARS_sim_2_ollama/demos/12-LLM_SIM_GPS_Message_Stream$ python main_gui.py

but i don't actually see a gui. i have the following code:

I am basing it on the following from a basic demo that still works. I have uploaded the rest of my simulation code as well


Looking at your code, the issue is that your matplotlib GUI isn't being displayed properly. The problem is in how you're setting up and running the matplotlib animation. Here are the key issues:
The matplotlib window isn't being forced to display before the animation starts
The animation creation and plt.show() might not be properly synchronized
There might be backend issues with TkAgg in WSL2


Looking at your code, I can now see the issue! The problem is that document 11 (the working GUI) uses a completely different approach than your current main_gui.py:Working GUI (document 11):

Uses matplotlib.use("Qt5Agg") backend
Uses FigureCanvasQTAgg (matplotlib embedded in PyQt5)
Uses QTimer for animation updates
Is a full PyQt5 application with matplotlib embedded
Your non-working GUI (document 9):

Uses matplotlib.use('TkAgg') backend
Uses standalone matplotlib windows
Uses FuncAnimation for animation
Is a matplotlib-only application trying to spawn PyQt5 dashboards
The issue is that you're mixing TkAgg matplotlib with PyQt5, which causes conflicts in WSL2. Here's the fixed version that uses the Qt5Agg backend properly:








I have the existing code that i am trying to make the following demo:  

an mcp chatapp 

multi-agent simulation 

GPS message generator for simulation

notification dashboard - a gui to monitor events in the simulation so i can see live telemetry streaming, and ultimately how often the LLM can help fix errors.

requirements tracker i'll be able to see all information about each agent to cross reference the reports the LLM gives me.

I ultimately want to be able to ask the llm for a report on the agents currently, and the LLM looks at the most current information for every agent from each database and makes a human friendly report. then i want to be able to move agents to specific coordinates. in the chatapp, i want to send a message to the user on startup giving a menu of commands and the bounds of the simulation coordinate system. I then also want to be able to have a converstation with the LLM about the simulation and have it be able to make human friendly -readable reports.

I want to make sure that my simulation is not getting over complicated, the agents should spawn in random locations, and move quadrant toward the mission end point, the mission end point should be in the top right most corner of the sim boundaries denoted by a star symbol, so placed at max x and max y. I want to be able to switch between algorithm control (if run into jamming, recover by going back to previous non jammed position, then go to a random coordinate withing a maximum allowed single iteration movement distance, if still jammed, go back to that spot and pick a new random spot, then continue on a linear path to the mission end point.

I only want the GPS simulator to help simulate acutall NMEA messages, don't worry about RTCM for now, just NMEA. I want to more accurately simulate that connection is lost or degraded when agents venture into jammed areas and have this reflected in the NMEA messages.

I want to overall make my simulation more simple but not reduce the core quality and components. telemetry is recorded to qdrant and all agent, LLM, and user messages are recorded to sql. 

Please ask clarifying questions as needed. Overall please show me what functions or files need to be updated. I want to make minimal changes but at the same time really make the whole thing simpler to meet my requirements.


Clarifying Questions
GPS Integration: Do you want the GPS constellation server to run as a separate service, or should it be integrated into the main simulation loop? Currently, agents query it over TCP.

Requirements Tracking: Should the 12 GPS denial requirements continue to be monitored, or can we simplify this to basic jamming detection (satellite count, signal quality, fix quality)?

LLM Reports: When you ask for a "report on agents," should it include:

Current positions and jamming status?
GPS metrics (satellites, signal quality)?
Movement history?
All of the above?



Startup Menu: Should this menu appear in the web chat interface, terminal, or both?

Database Strategy: You mentioned telemetry → Qdrant, messages → PostgreSQL. Should we keep both or simplify to just PostgreSQL with vector extension?


GPS- i want the best solution that is the simplest for me to get the results i need, i am only trying to show how LLM can improve performace of a multi agent swarm. the GPS generator is really just for creating simulated telemetry and generate warnings and errors for the LLM to take into consideration when creating reports and also assisting with moving agents automatically.

Requirements Tracking - it would be nice to simplify for now, i can always add requirements later, but keep the ability to add requirements in the future. for now just basic jamming detection is fine.

LLM Reports: When you ask for a "report on agents," should it include:

for a "current status" report i just want: Current positions and jamming status, GPS metrics (satellites, signal quality)

this should be good enough for now.

but please don't hard code any message monitoring in the mcp chatapp. i want the LLM to interpret what the user wants through the MCP chatapp and then query the databases as needed to get the most current information or simply be able to say to return the commands menu or something.


also let me know if i should delete script.js dev@DB-78GB094:~/CARS_sim_2_ollama/demos/12-LLM_SIM_GPS_Message_Stream$ tree . ├── README.md ├── cmds.md ├── constellation_config.json ├── docker-compose.yml ├── docs │ ├── scc2-2.md │ ├── swarm_c2-1.md │ ├── swarm_comms.md │ └── swarm_control1.md ├── gps_client_lib.py ├── launch_ollama.md ├── launch_ollama.sh ├── llm_config.py ├── main_gui.py ├── mcp_chatapp.py ├── notification_dashboard.py ├── prompts.md ├── rag_store.py ├── requirements_config.json ├── sat_constellation.py ├── sim_helper_funcs.py ├── sim_reqs_tracker.py ├── startup.py ├── static │ ├── css │ │ ├── base.css │ │ ├── chat.css │ │ ├── columns.css │ │ ├── header.css │ │ ├── logs.css │ │ └── style.css │ └── js │ ├── chat.js │ ├── health.js │ ├── logs.js │ ├── main.js │ ├── script.js │ ├── state.js │ ├── streaming.js │ └── utils.js ├── templates │ └── index.html ├── test_gui_display.py ├── todo.md └── vehicle_requirements_tracker.py 5 directories, 40 files dev@DB-78GB094:~/CARS_sim_2_ollama/demos/12-LLM_SIM_GPS_Message_Stream$   I am updating my code based on the simulation refactor plan. have i properly implemented the changes? i know mcp_chatapp.py is not updated yet so please create the full new version of that file. what other changes or updates are still needed to better fit my requiremetns? then what commands do i run to get everything running? the docker compose, the gps constellation, the main simulation, and the chatapp?
